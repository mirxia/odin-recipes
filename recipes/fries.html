            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>French fries (or chips in the UK) are a widely beloved dish consisting of batonnet or julienne-cut potatoes that are typically deep-fried until they achieve a crispy, golden exterior and a soft, fluffy interior. Seasoned primarily with salt, they are served hot as a popular side dish, snack, or fast-food staple, commonly paired with various condiments such as ketchup, mayonnaise, or aioli, and are a core item found in cuisines across the globe.</p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 ½ pounds russet potatoes, peeled</li>
                <li>1 cup vegetable oil for frying</li>
                <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon garlic salt</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon onion salt</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>½ cup water, or as needed</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Slice potatoes into French fries and place them into a large bowl of cold water to prevent them from turning brown.</li>
                <li>Heat oil in a heavy saucepan or large skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
                <li>While the oil is heating, sift flour, garlic salt, onion salt, paprika, and salt into a large bowl. Gradually stir in enough water to make a slightly thick batter that can be drizzled from a spoon.</li>
                <li>Drain fries and pat dry; dip into the batter one at a time.</li>
                <li>Lower fries carefully into the hot oil in batches to prevent them from clumping together. Fry until golden brown and crispy on all sides, about 7 to 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Drain fries on a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
                <li>Serve hot and enjoy! </li>
            </ol>
