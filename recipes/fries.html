        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>French fries (or chips in the UK) are a widely beloved dish consisting of batonnet or julienne-cut potatoes that are typically deep-fried until they achieve a crispy, golden exterior and a soft, fluffy interior. Seasoned primarily with salt, they are served hot as a popular side dish, snack, or fast-food staple, commonly paired with various condiments such as ketchup, mayonnaise, or aioli, and are a core item found in cuisines across the globe.</p>
