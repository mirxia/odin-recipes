            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Fried chicken wings are a hugely popular appetizer and main dish, prepared by deep-frying the unsegmented or separated wing portions (drumettes and flats) until the skin is wonderfully crispy and golden brown, while the meat remains tender and juicy. They are often marinated in seasonings or coated in a seasoned flour and starch mixture before frying to enhance flavor and crunch, and are famously served either plain and salted or, more commonly, tossed in a sauce like classic Buffalo, smoky barbecue, garlic parmesan, or sticky Korean gochujang, making them a versatile, finger-food staple.</p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>12 small chicken wings</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon seasoned salt, or to taste</li>
                <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon coarse salt</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon ground paprika</li>
                <li>2 quarts vegetable oil for frying</li>
                <li>1 (12 fluid ounce) bottle Buffalo wing sauce (such as Frank's), or to taste</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
                <li>Season chicken wings lightly with seasoned salt.</li>
                <li>Mix flour, salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and paprika together in a wide, shallow bowl. Press wings into flour mixture to coat and arrange in a single layer on a large plate. Refrigerate coated wings for 15 to 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Dredge wings again in flour mixture and return to the plate. Refrigerate wings once more for 15 to 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Fry chicken wings in hot oil until crisp and juices run clear, 10 to 12 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the meat, near the bone, should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Transfer fried wings to a large bowl. Drizzle sauce over wings and toss to coat.</li>
                <li>Serve and enjoy! </li>
            </ol>
