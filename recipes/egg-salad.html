        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Egg salad is a classic, creamy cold dish consisting of chopped hard-boiled eggs bound together with a rich dressing made primarily from mayonnaise and seasoned with ingredients like mustard, salt, and pepper. It often includes other chopped elements for flavor and crunch, such as celery, onions, or fresh herbs like chives and dill, and is most famously served as the filling for a sandwich on bread or toast, though it is also enjoyed on crackers or over a bed of greens.</p>
